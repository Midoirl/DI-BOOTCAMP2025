The Role of Data Analysis in Transforming Insurance Claims Processing
Introduction
In today’s fast-paced digital economy, data analysis is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. This report examines a 2025 case study from the insurance sector where data analysis, paired with AI, played a pivotal role in transforming claims processing. The study, conducted by Khayatbashi et al , explores how object-centric process mining (OCPM) was used to evaluate the integration of large language models (LLMs) in automating claim part identification.

The Business Problem
Insurance companies face immense pressure to process claims efficiently while maintaining accuracy. A persistent bottleneck in this process is the manual identification of individual claim components—a task that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. As demand increases, traditional workflows become unsustainable, prompting the need for automation.

The Role of Data Analysis
The researchers employed Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) to analyze complex event logs within insurance workflows. This method tracks the movement and interaction of various ‘objects’ (e.g., customers, claims, claim parts) through a process. By doing so, it revealed inefficiencies and helped assess the performance of AI-driven solutions compared to manual methods.
Data analysis helped answer key questions:
How did the AI affect process speed and accuracy?


What new patterns or complications emerged?


Were any hidden bottlenecks introduced by the AI?



AI Implementation
Large Language Models (LLMs) were trained on historical insurance data to automate the identification of claim parts. These models were embedded into the company’s existing systems to reduce manual work and streamline the processing pipeline.

Findings and Outcomes
Data analysis yielded powerful insights:
Efficiency increased significantly, with faster claim resolution times.


Operational capacity improved, allowing more claims to be processed with fewer resources.


New challenges were discovered—such as emerging workflow complexities and unforeseen dependencies introduced by AI.


These findings were only visible due to the granularity and scope of the data analysis performed. Without it, the AI's performance might have been misjudged or oversimplified.

Impact of Data Analysis
Without data analysis:
The AI’s actual impact would remain unclear.


Process weaknesses would go unnoticed.


Continuous improvement would be impossible.


In contrast, data-driven insights enabled the team to refine their systems, detect anomalies, and build a roadmap for further automation with confidence.

Conclusion
This case demonstrates that data analysis is the backbone of effective AI integration. It not only measures success but also uncovers hidden pitfalls. In the context of insurance, data analysis empowered decision-makers to optimize operations, reduce costs, and future-proof their business processes.

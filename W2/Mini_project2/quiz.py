#1 class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines a set of attributes and methods.

# 2. An instance is a concrete object created based on the structure defined by a class.

# 3. Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, typically a class.

# 4. Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.


# 5. Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class derives properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class.

# 6.Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.

# 7. Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.

# 8.MRO defines the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. It uses the C3 linearization algorithm.

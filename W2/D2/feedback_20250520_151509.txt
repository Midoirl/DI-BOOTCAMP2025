suggestions for improvement:
- The constructor should allow initialization with either radius or diameter.
- The `__gt__` method in the Circle class has a bug. It should compare `self.radius` with `other_circle.radius`.
- The `__eq__` method has a similar bug; it should compare `self.radius` with `other_circle.radius`.
- Add a `diameter` property (getter and setter) for better encapsulation.
- The test cases have incorrect expected outputs.  For example, `print(str(c1))` should print 'Circle is with radius 200', not 'Circle is with radius 3'.
- Consider adding more comprehensive test cases to cover edge cases (e.g., circles with radius 0, negative radius).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code implements most of the required dunder methods (`__str__`, `__add__`, `__gt__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`). However, it doesn't allow the circle to be defined by diameter and has bugs in the comparison methods.  The bonus task (turtle graphics) is implemented, but test cases contain several inaccuracies. The core functionality is largely present, but needs adjustments for completeness and accuracy as specified in the chapter content.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow.  Method names and variable names are descriptive.  The comments are helpful in explaining the purpose of each method. The code could benefit from using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `other_circle` could be `other`)
- performance: The code's performance is good for the given task. The area calculation is straightforward and efficient.  There are no obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in the code.
